## Xiaomi Smart Home - Homegear Interface
V0.7.0 supports firmware version 1.4.1_159.0143

supports Homegear 0.7.x 

# Step 1: bring Xiaomi Gateway in developer mode #

1. Install the MiHome app on your mobile phone
2. Set region to: Mainland China under settings > Locale
3. You can set language to English
4. Select your Gateway in MiHome
5. Click the 3 dots at the top right of the screen
6. Click on about
7. Tap the version number at the bottom of the screen repeatedly
8. Two extra options will appear in English (in Chinese in earlier versions) until you did now enable the developer mode
9. Choose the first new option
10. Then tap the first toggle switch to enable LAN functions. Write down the password (Needed in Homegear)
11. Make sure you hit the OK button to save the  changes
12. Be aware: Every time you change something, the password will change!

All Xiaomi devices have to be added in MiHome app.

# Step 2: install Xiaomi devices #
1. make a ssh connection to homegear device
2. copy all *.xml files to /etc/homegear/devices/254/
3. copy all *.php files to /var/lib/homegear/scripts/DeviceScripts/Xiaomi/
4. Restart homegear (sudo service homegear restart)
5. if you have changed homegear default path, you have to use the customized paths instead
6. run 'homegear -e rs DeviceScripts/Xiaomi/MiSmartHome.php'
7. the script will autodiscover all available Xiaomi devices (see supported devices below) and auto-create Homegear devices
8. add the password from step 1.10 for the gateway device: `homegear -e rc '$hg->putParamset(<gateway peer id>,0,["PASSWORD"=>"<enter password>"]);'`
